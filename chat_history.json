Here's a plan for the initial version of your app:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n-   **Home Screen:** Display a curated list of popular dishes, special offers, and featured restaurants. Include a search bar for users to quickly find specific items or cuisines.\n-   **Restaurant Listings:** A dedicated screen showcasing available restaurants, their menus, customer reviews, and estimated delivery times.\n-   **Order Placement:** A streamlined ordering process with a shopping cart, secure payment options, and order tracking functionality.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F8F8FF` (Almost White)\n    *   Text: `#282828` (Dark Gray)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#585858` (Medium Gray)\n    *   Primary: `#FF7F50` (Coral)\n    *   Secondary: `#6495ED` (Cornflower Blue)\n    *   Accent: `#FFD700` (Gold)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    *   Highlight: `#90EE90` (LightGreen)\n*   **Typography:** Use modern, clean fonts like \"System\" for a native feel.\n\nNow, let's create a plan for the code changes.\n\n1.  **Project Setup:** No changes needed here, assuming the project is already set up with React Native and Expo.\n2.  **Home Screen (`app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`):**\n    *   Modify the existing component to include a search bar and a list of featured restaurants/dishes. This will involve adding new UI elements (TextInput, FlatList) and potentially fetching data (initially, this can be hardcoded).\n3.  **Restaurant Listings Screen (`app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` and a new file, `app/(tabs)/restaurants/index.tsx`):**\n    *   Update the tab layout to include a \"Restaurants\" tab.\n    *   Create a new `restaurants/index.tsx` file to display a list of restaurants with relevant details.\n4.  **Order Placement (New files: `app/order/index.tsx`, `components/Cart.tsx`):**\n    *   Create an `order/index.tsx` file to handle the order placement process. This will include UI for the shopping cart, address input, and payment options.\n    *   Create a `components/Cart.tsx` component to manage the shopping cart functionality.\n5.  **Navigation:** Ensure seamless navigation between the Home, Restaurants, and Order screens using Expo's navigation library.\n\nAfter the coding agent implements the plan, please remove the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-11-30T15:50:55.130091"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create an Indian takeaway delivery order app!
