Here's a plan for the initial version of your app:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n-   **Home Screen:** Display a curated list of popular dishes, special offers, and featured restaurants. Include a search bar for users to quickly find specific items or cuisines.\n-   **Restaurant Listings:** A dedicated screen showcasing available restaurants, their menus, customer reviews, and estimated delivery times.\n-   **Order Placement:** A streamlined ordering process with a shopping cart, secure payment options, and order tracking functionality.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F8F8FF` (Almost White)\n    *   Text: `#282828` (Dark Gray)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#585858` (Medium Gray)\n    *   Primary: `#FF7F50` (Coral)\n    *   Secondary: `#6495ED` (Cornflower Blue)\n    *   Accent: `#FFD700` (Gold)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    *   Highlight: `#90EE90` (LightGreen)\n*   **Typography:** Use modern, clean fonts like \"System\" for a native feel.\n\nNow, let's create a plan for the code changes.\n\n1.  **Project Setup:** No changes needed here, assuming the project is already set up with React Native and Expo.\n2.  **Home Screen (`app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`):**\n    *   Modify the existing component to include a search bar and a list of featured restaurants/dishes. This will involve adding new UI elements (TextInput, FlatList) and potentially fetching data (initially, this can be hardcoded).\n3.  **Restaurant Listings Screen (`app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` and a new file, `app/(tabs)/restaurants/index.tsx`):**\n    *   Update the tab layout to include a \"Restaurants\" tab.\n    *   Create a new `restaurants/index.tsx` file to display a list of restaurants with relevant details.\n4.  **Order Placement (New files: `app/order/index.tsx`, `components/Cart.tsx`):**\n    *   Create an `order/index.tsx` file to handle the order placement process. This will include UI for the shopping cart, address input, and payment options.\n    *   Create a `components/Cart.tsx` component to manage the shopping cart functionality.\n5.  **Navigation:** Ensure seamless navigation between the Home, Restaurants, and Order screens using Expo's navigation library.\n\nAfter the coding agent implements the plan, please remove the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-11-30T15:50:55.130091"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create an Indian takeaway delivery order app!

Here's a breakdown of potential causes and how to address them:\n\n1.  **Check for Errors:** The first step is to examine the runtime logs for any error messages. Use the `read_runtime_logs()` tool to check for any errors. These logs often provide clues about what's going wrong.\n\n2.  **Review Recent Changes:** Since the recent changes involved significant modifications to the app's structure and UI, it's possible that an error was introduced during these updates. Carefully review the code changes in the files mentioned earlier (`app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`, `app/menu/[id].tsx`, `app/cart.tsx`, `data/restaurants.ts`, `contexts/CartContext.tsx`) to identify any potential issues.\n\n3.  **Inspect Data Loading:** If the app relies on data, ensure that the data is being loaded correctly. If the data source has changed or if there are issues with the data itself, it could prevent the app from rendering properly.\n\n4.  **Verify Component Rendering:** Check if the main components are rendering correctly. There might be a conditional rendering issue that prevents components from being displayed.\n\n5.  **Metro Bundler Issues:** Sometimes, the Metro bundler can encounter issues that prevent the app from loading correctly. Try clearing the Metro bundler cache and restarting the bundler. You can also try resetting the Expo project.\n\n6.  **Dependency Issues:** Ensure that all dependencies are installed correctly and that there are no version conflicts. Try reinstalling the dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.\n\n7.  **React Native and Expo Compatibility:** Verify that the versions of React Native and Expo are compatible.

Here's what has been implemented:\n\n### \u2705 Database Structure Created\n\n**Tables Created:**\n\n1. **menu** - Menu items with:\n   - name (text)\n   - price (decimal)\n   - spicy (boolean)\n   - image_id (text)\n   - description, category, is_vegetarian, is_popular fields\n   - 17 menu items pre-populated from your existing data\n\n2. **users** - User profiles extending auth.users with:\n   - name, phone\n   - email_verified, phone_verified flags\n   - Linked to Supabase Auth\n\n3. **addresses** - User delivery addresses with:\n   - label (Home/Work/Other)\n   - street_address, city, postcode\n   - contact_name, is_default flag\n\n4. **payment_methods** - User payment methods with:\n   - type (card/paypal/apple_pay/google_pay/cash)\n   - card details (last4, brand, expiry)\n   - is_default flag\n\n5. **orders** - Order records with:\n   - order_type (delivery/collection)\n   - status tracking\n   - subtotal, delivery_fee, discount, total\n   - payment and delivery information\n\n6. **order_items** - Items in each order with:\n   - menu_item reference\n   - quantity and pricing snapshots\n\n### \ud83d\udd12 Security Implemented\n\n- **Row Level Security (RLS)** enabled on all tables\n- **Public read access** for menu items\n- **User-specific access** for addresses, payment methods, and orders\n- **Proper foreign key relationships** between tables\n\n### \ud83c\udfa3 React Hooks Created\n\n1. **useMenu()** - Fetch and manage menu items from database\n2. **useAddresses()** - Manage user delivery addresses\n3. **useOrders()** - Create and manage orders\n\n### \ud83d\udd04 Integration Complete\n\n- **AuthContext** updated to use Supabase Auth\n- **Home screen** now loads menu from database\n- **TypeScript types** generated from database schema\n- **Email verification** flow implemented with proper redirects\n\n### \ud83d\udcca Database Features\n\n- Automatic timestamps (created_at, updated_at)\n- Indexed fields for performance\n- Proper cascading deletes\n- Default values where appropriate\n\n### \ud83d\ude80 Next Steps\n\nThe database is ready to use! The app will now:\n\n- Load menu items from Supabase\n- Authenticate users with email verification\n- Store user profiles, addresses, and payment methods\n- Track orders and order history\n\nAll data is now persisted in your Supabase database \"thePalace\" and the app is fully connected!"}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "commit", "commit_id": "8836e3373bbbabe1b183b8280f196c39448c658f", "message": "feat: Update home screen to use database menu items", "timestamp": "2025-11-30T21:41:48Z", "files_changed": ["app/integrations/supabase/types.ts", "hooks/useOrders.ts", "contexts/AuthContext.tsx", "hooks/useAddresses.ts", "hooks/useMenu.ts", "app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx"], "update_number": 15, "parent_commit_id": "ad52826dfb92523d3c42f606abd9b775925d2b31"}], "timestamp": "2025-11-30T21:35:47Z"}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Implement spice level functionality.\nSeparate Relational db for spice level set.\nSpice button on top right of image on each item that has spice boolean set to true.\nbutton has plus minus which pressing it shows more emoji.\n1 press 1 chilli emoji.\nAdd or minus another spice level with emoji showing.

I've successfully implemented the spice level functionality for your Indian takeaway delivery order app. Here's a summary of what was implemented:\n\n## Summary of Changes\n\n### 1. **Database Structure** \u2705\nThe `menu_item_spice_levels` table already exists in your Supabase database with:\n- `menu_item_id` - Links to the menu item\n- `user_id` - For authenticated users\n- `session_id` - For guest sessions\n- `spice_level` - Integer (0-3)\n- RLS policies for secure access\n\n### 2. **New Components & Hooks**\n\n**SpiceButton Component** (`components/SpiceButton.tsx`):\n- Displays a chilli emoji button on the top right of menu item images\n- Shows a badge with the current spice level\n- Opens a modal with +/- controls to adjust spice level (0-3)\n- Displays chilli emojis representing the selected level\n\n**useSpiceLevel Hook** (`hooks/useSpiceLevel.ts`):\n- Manages spice level state for each menu item\n- Handles guest session IDs using AsyncStorage\n- Fetches and updates spice levels in Supabase\n- Provides increment/decrement functions\n\n### 3. **Updated Files**\n\n**CartContext** (`contexts/CartContext.tsx`):\n- Added `spiceLevel` property to cart items\n- Updated `addToCart` to accept spice level parameter\n- Added `updateSpiceLevel` function\n- Cart items with different spice levels are treated as separate items\n\n**Menu Screen** (`app/menu/[id].tsx`):\n- Integrated SpiceButton component\n- Only displays spice button for items where `spicy` is true\n- Passes spice level when adding items to cart\n- Uses the `useSpiceLevel` hook to get current spice level\n\n**Cart Screen** (`app/cart.tsx`):\n- Displays chilli emojis next to items with spice levels\n- Shows spice level in the order summary receipt view\n- Properly formats the receipt with spice indicators\n\n**Types** (`types/restaurant.ts`):\n- Added optional `spiceLevel` property to `CartItem` interface\n\n**Supabase Types** (`app/integrations/supabase/types.ts`):\n- Updated with the `menu_item_spice_levels` table definition\n\n### 4. **Key Features**\n\n- **Spice Button**: Appears on top right of menu item images (only for spicy items)\n- **Spice Levels**: 0-3 levels, represented by chilli emojis (\ud83c\udf36\ufe0f)\n- **Guest Support**: Uses session IDs stored in AsyncStorage for non-logged-in users\n- **Database Storage**: Spice preferences are stored in Supabase\n- **Cart Integration**: Spice level is included when adding items to cart\n- **Checkout Display**: Shows chilli emojis next to items in the order summary\n\n### 5. **User Flow**\n\n1. User browses menu and sees spice button on spicy items\n2. Taps spice button to open modal\n3. Uses +/- buttons to adjust spice level (0-3)\n4. Spice level is saved to database (per user/session)\n5. When adding to cart, the selected spice level is included\n6. In checkout, chilli emojis display next to items with spice levels\n\nThe implementation is complete and ready to use! The spice level functionality is now fully integrated with your restaurant ordering app, with proper database storage, guest session support, and a clean UI that matches your existing design."}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "commit", "commit_id": "9df326f073d1d868ce4f7fe132c37a49c51dcd33", "message": "feat: Implement spice level functionality for menu items\n", "timestamp": "2025-11-30T22:14:15Z", "files_changed": ["app/menu/[id].tsx", "app/cart.tsx", "contexts/CartContext.tsx", "components/SpiceButton.tsx", "hooks/useSpiceLevel.ts", "app/integrations/supabase/types.ts", "types/restaurant.ts"], "update_number": 16, "parent_commit_id": "8836e3373bbbabe1b183b8280f196c39448c658f"}], "timestamp": "2025-11-30T22:08:01Z"}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Create in DB subHeading categories item.\nLoad this menu from DB\noptions\nAll Items\nAppetizers\nChefs Special\nBiryani\nMain\nVegetable side,\nRice\nBreads\nDesserts \nDrinks"}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Okay, I will implement the sub-heading categories for the menu items and load the menu from the Supabase database.\n\nHere's the list of features to add:\n\n1.

I've successfully migrated your Supabase tables from UUID to integer IDs. Here's a summary of what was done:\n\n## Changes Made:\n\n### 1. **Database Migrations** (Applied via Supabase)\n   - **`menu_categories` table**: Migrated from UUID to SERIAL (auto-incrementing integer) primary key\n   - **`menu` table**: Migrated from UUID to SERIAL primary key\n   - **`menu_item_spice_levels` table**: Migrated from UUID to SERIAL primary key, with foreign key to `menu(id)` as integer\n\n### 2. **TypeScript Types Updated**\n   - **`app/integrations/supabase/types.ts`**: Updated to reflect the new integer ID types for `menu`, `menu_categories`, and `menu_item_spice_levels` tables\n\n### 3. **Application Code Updated**\n   - **`types/restaurant.ts`**: Changed `Dish.id` from `string` to `number`\n   - **`contexts/CartContext.tsx`**: Updated all dish ID parameters from `string` to `number`\n   - **`hooks/useSpiceLevel.ts`**: Changed `menuItemId` parameter from `string` to `number`\n   - **`components/SpiceButton.tsx`**: Changed `menuItemId` prop from `string` to `number`\n   - **`app/menu/[id].tsx`**: Updated to work with integer IDs throughout\n\n### 4. **Data Preservation**\n   - All existing data was copied from the old tables to the new tables during migration\n   - RLS policies were recreated on the new tables\n   - Indexes were added for better performance on the `menu_item_spice_levels` table\n\n### 5. **Key Benefits**\n   - Integer IDs are more efficient for database operations\n   - Smaller storage footprint\n   - Faster indexing and joins\n   - Auto-incrementing IDs are simpler to work with\n\nThe migration is complete and your app should now be using integer IDs for the menu-related tables while maintaining all existing functionality!"}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}], "timestamp": "2025-12-12T23:40:27Z"}]
